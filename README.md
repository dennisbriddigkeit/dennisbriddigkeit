# Hi, I'm Dennis ðŸ‘‹

### Product Manager at [awork.com](https://awork.com) Â· Creative Builder Â· Gaming Enthuisast

I love building, shaping, and refiningâ€”whether itâ€™s products, tools, or events. I'm a product manager with a thing for clean UX, clear structure, and creative solutions. At night, I'm working on small web projects, and web tools for [total verpLANt](https://total-verplant.de), where we organize gaming events for kids, teens, and grown-up nerds like me. By day, I'm a product maanager at awork.
