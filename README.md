# Hi, I'm Dennis ðŸ‘‹

I love building, shaping, and refiningâ€”whether itâ€™s products, tools, or events. I'm a product manager with a thing for clean UX, clear structure, and creative solutions. At night, I'm working on small personal web projects or web tools for [total verpLANt](https://total-verplant.de), where we organize gaming events for kids, teens, and grown-up nerds like me or run my own game studio [Curvature Games](https://www.curvaturegames.com). By day, I'm a product manager at [awork](https://awork.com)
