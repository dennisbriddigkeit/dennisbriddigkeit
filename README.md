# Hi, I'm Dennis 👋

### Product Manager at awork.com · Creative Builder · Gaming Nerd

I love building, shaping, and refining—whether it’s products, tools, or events. I'm a product manager with a thing for clean UX, clear structure, and creative solutions. Right now, I'm working on my portfolio site and building web tools for [total verpLANt](https://total-verplant.de), where we organize gaming events for kids, teens, and grown-up nerds like me.
